Sparse-Poly-Calculator-C-
=========================

A C++ Sparse Poly calculator that can add or multiply polynomials created in the main driver. The program utilizes vectors to store the polynomial term values. It automatically sorts the terms from least to greatest exponent order. I wish I had such a program back in high school to tackle those tedious polynomial problems.
